# DataEngineeringCourseProject
### This project contains data engineering tasks done on the google playstore apps dataset. In this project we try to find some answers for some questions an app producer may ask. Here we help app producers understand the features which affect customer statisfication. We aim at finding relationships between some app features and the app rating. This may help app producers reach high customer satisfaction.
